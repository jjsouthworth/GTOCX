# GTOCX GUI Toolset

To run the GUI, retrieve your favorite installation of Python. 
The easy way to do this is to grab an installation of Miniconda. 
Please select Python 2.7 64 bit installer for your system.

[Miniconda Download Page](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

From the "conda" command in the installation directory (Linux), or from the 
Anaconda prompt installed with Miniconda (Windows), install the following:

`
./conda install numpy matplotlib pyqt pyopengl pyqtgraph
`

To run the gui, please invoke the Python installed (Either from the anaconda 
prompt or the python executable in the miniconda/bin directory) and point it at
python/plot_set.py


Please submit issues for anything that doesn't work!
